# Should I Take I66?

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/YQxKRep.png)

A simple webView application for iOS using [sepehr500's](https://github.com/sepehr500) open source toll monitoring [site](https://github.com/sepehr500/i66tolls).

This app monitors the ever changing prices for the I66 tolls.

Full iOS implementation without using a webView is planned, for sometime in the future....maybe.

To install on iOS device download and compiled using Xcode. iOS 11 required.
